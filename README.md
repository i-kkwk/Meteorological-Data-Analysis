# What's the Weather Like?

## Background

Utilized Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## Part I - WeatherPy

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Utilized a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Final:

* Randomly selected **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Performed a weather check on each of the cities used a series of successive API calls.
* Included a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Saved a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

### Part II - VacationPy

Used weather data to plan future vacations. Used jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for weather data to plan future vacations.

* Created a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I.

* Narrow down the DataFrame to find ideal of weather condition. 


For example:

  * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.

  * Wind speed less than 10 mph.

  * Zero cloudiness.

  * Drop any rows that didn't contain all three conditions and to be sure the weather is ideal.

 
* Used Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of the coordinates.

* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin contained the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.
